### My Initial Connection with Electronic Devices

I was always fascinated from the early age when i look at the lights, moving toys. As far i remember at the age of 4, my father bought a battery bike toy (wired). It takes a medium size battery with a long wire and it has 2 controls to move forward and backward. The design of the bike is awesome and i was given only few mintes to play with and my father keep them in the locked cupboard.

From then i was excited to play with multiple devices and also much interested to know how these devices work together. Then whenever my parents bought me a new toy i will play with them for few days and unscrew them to see how things are assembled at an early age of 5. Then i will try to re-assemble them perfectly back to the original state with some minor dents here and there. I don;t have any tools and most of the time i used the spoons and knife to remove the screws.

The day which i came to know about the positive and negative terminals of a battery. Even before proper knowledge from the school i realized that every battery has +ve and -ve terminal through which the device get the energy to perform. Out of curiosity, i broke down the mini bullter scooter to see how these wheels running. ?. Then there is a small motor connects those wheels via rubber belt. I went further to open the motor and dissect the inner components.

It had some coils and magnet. I reversed the polarrity of the battery to these motor terminals and came to know that the motor spins clockwise and anti-clockwise when i swaped the battery terminals respectively. This explains how the scooter went forward and backward based on the controls. Later in the school when my Physics teacher exaplains about the Magnetic Induction and Electricity it was very simple for me to understand all these concepts

### Battery vs Electricity

I didn't have a formal knowledge about Electricity vs Battery. Whenever there is shortage of battery i simply connected the device terminals direclty to the electricity power in the home
