# Launch Extension Setup

Adobe released Launch Extension which is the next Generation Platform for Tag management. It simplifies the workflow involved in the development, testing and deployment of tags to website. Launch Extension is a platform where multiple external third party tag services can be easily integrated through Extension Catalog Store.

# Development

The entire development and tooling for the Launch Extension uses the Web Development stack of NodeJS HTML and Javascript.

Extension Components

- Data Elements : Create new DataElements and share the data across extensions
- Rules -> Rules are at the logical core of your implementation and control the what, when, where, and how of all the tags on your site. Create a New Rule using the Events,Conditions and Actions
- Events : Click, Swipe
- Condition : Apply the Action only for specific condition. e.g A, BODY, DIV.
- Action : ShowAlert, SendAnalyticsToThirdParty

# Scaffolding a New Extension

Scaffolding cli helps developers to generate the necessary boilerplates for the events,actions and conditions. By default it includes the entries in the manifest extension.json file

```
npx @adobe/reactor-scaffold
```

# Sandbox : Local Development Environment

```
npx @adobe/reactor-sandbox
```

# Create a Build Package for uploading

```
npx @adobe/reactor-packager
```

# Uploading the package to Adobe Catalog Store

```
npx @adobe/reactor-uploader
```

# Debug from Console

```
_satellite.setDebug(true)

```
